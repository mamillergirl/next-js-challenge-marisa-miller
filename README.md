# Open Library Search Challenge Entry

## Overview

Welcome to my submission for the Open Library Search Challenge! In this project, I've created a Next.js application that fulfills all the objectives outlined in the challenge requirements. Despite being new to Next.js, I successfully implemented features such as book search functionality, displaying search results, detailed book view, pagination, and ensured responsiveness for both desktop and mobile devices. The application is designed to be intuitive, responsive, and user-friendly.

## Features

- **Search Functionality**: Implemented a search feature using the Open Library Search API.
- **List Results**: Displayed search results with relevant information about the books.
- **Detailed View**: Enabled users to view detailed information about a book by selecting it from the search results.
- **Pagination**: Implemented pagination for the search results to improve user experience.
- **Responsiveness**: Ensured the application works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
